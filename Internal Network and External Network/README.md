# Internal Network (Intranet) vs. External Network (Internet):

## Internal Network (Intranet):

**Definition:** The internal network, also known as an intranet, is a private computer network that operates within an organization or company. It is used to facilitate communication and information sharing among devices within the same network.

**Restricted Access:** The intranet is restricted to devices and resources owned by the organization. Typically, only employees, authorized members, or internal systems have access to it.

**Security:** Intranets are generally highly secure, with stringent data protection measures and access control. This is crucial for safeguarding confidential information and company data.

**Resource Sharing:** In internal networks, shared resources may include file servers, internal databases, network printers, and company-specific applications.

**Controlled Performance:** The organization has full control over the internal network infrastructure, allowing for performance optimization and quality of service as needed.

**Collaboration:** Intranets are used to facilitate collaboration among team members, enabling document sharing, internal communication, and access to internal systems.

## External Network (Internet):

**Definition:** The external network, known as the internet, is a vast global network of interconnected computers that enables communication and information sharing on a worldwide scale.

**Public Access:** The internet is publicly accessible and global, meaning anyone with an internet connection can access it. It is not restricted to a specific organization.

**Varied Security:** Internet security varies widely. While there are security measures such as firewalls and encryption, there are also security risks such as cyber threats and hacking.

**Shared Resources:** On the internet, shared resources include websites, email services, social media, search engines, cloud services, and more.

**Variable Performance:** Internet performance can vary depending on location, connection speed, and the global network's load. It is not controlled by a single entity.

**Global Communication:** The internet enables communication and collaboration on a global scale. It plays a vital role in connecting countries, businesses, and people worldwide.

## Key Differences:

- **Scope:** The intranet is private and limited to an organization, whereas the internet is public and global.

- **Control:** The organization has complete control over its intranet, while the internet is decentralized and not controlled by a single entity.

- **Security:** Intranets are generally more secure due to stricter control, whereas the internet is more vulnerable to external threats.

- **Purpose:** Intranets are used for internal organizational purposes, such as resource sharing and collaboration. The internet is used for global communication and access to public information.

In summary, the internal network (intranet) is used for internal operations and private communication within an organization, while the external network (internet) is a global network that enables communication and information sharing on a worldwide scale. Both play critical roles in modern operations but have different scopes and security requirements.
